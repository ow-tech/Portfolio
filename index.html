			<p>[Ninety Nines Flying School] — [Ground School and Simulation Private Pilot License]<br>
				Time : [2015] — [2017]<br>
				This is a passion that still burns in me. Unluckily, I never got the chance to<br>
				finish my final license due to financial issues. Never given up but just took a <br>
				pause. For sure i will be going back to this field but as a bush pilot And<br>
				perhaps an aviator who solves aviation problems by means of coding and forming of<br>
				aligorithms.
			</p>
			<p>[Glory Secondary School] — [Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education]<br>
				Time: [2012] — [2015]<br>
				Score: B<br>
				Back hear I had basically no idea what i will be after my high-school education.<br>
				howerver for sure i knew that i was going to land somewhere in the aviation industry.<br>
				How the future hides itself from us. It is the beauty of life. We will never know <br>
				tommorrow. The reason why we as humans always hope for the best but also be prepared<br>
				for the worst.
			</p>
			<p>[Ngei Primary School] — [Kenya Certificate of Primary Education]<br>
				Time: [2003] — [2012]<br>
				Score: B<br>
				The begining of it all. Basically i have very little memory of <br>
				this great childhood. I can recall I loved to play so much.

			<h3>Nationalism and Identity</h3>
			<p>Nationalism: Kenyan (By Birth and Registration</p>
			<P>Marital Status: Maried</P>
			<p>Obejectives:Focus to what is at hand, enjoy it as it lasts<br>
											and also keep in mind towards long term goals</p>
			<h3>Work Experience</h3>
			<P>Online Based Tutor</P>
			Time: 2017-Up-to-date: <br>
			<p>Basically, I usualy help students tackle their projects<br>
			by either providng them with a worked our sample or taking then<br>
		through areas that they feel that they are blockers.<br>
		This has been a way of me to make a living and support myself<br>
		in areas of handling my bills. It is a field that is time demanding<br>
	since in most cases, i tutor students from a time zone that is opposite<br>
to mine. This means that i have to be awake during the nigh and also<br>
during the day so as to have a normal life like any other Kenyan.</p>

		<h3>Why on am in Coding Class</h3>
		<p>It comes a point in life when one has to decide on whether awaiting for his time to
			so that he can get to accomplish his/her interests, goals, and milestones or giving himself
			a chance to have atleast a glimpse of light to his/her future. Coding was never in my mind 
			but having not commpleted any higher education level, I decided to try out coding. The begining
			of the journey was not easy, but with the motivation to accomplish, I have manged to pick
			myself up, ofcouse with the help of peers and technical mentors. I can proudly say that
			i am slowy and steadily grasping coding skills. Am loving it.

			with a group of 4.</P>

			<ol>
				<li>Photoshoot-Gallery</li>
				<p>The <a href="https://ow-tech.github.io/photography-Gallery/" target="_blank">Photoshoot-Gallery</a> is a wepbape that showcases the photography-Gallery<br>
				of a phtographer that has a business by the name KennyPhotography. The intention was for him to be able<br>
				to post his best shoots so that he gets a chance to advertise himself in the wepbage. The images that are<br>
				are found in his gallery, are a selection of his best work. The webpage does not leave the aspect of giving a <br>
				description of how he operates and he humble beginings.</p>
				<li>Black-Collor-Jobs</li>
				<P>The <a href="https://ow-tech.github.io/Black-color-services-jobs/" target="_blank"> Black-Collor-Jobs</a> is a group project that was done by 4 people, with<br>
				myself included. The project was basically aiming to connect serice providers; i.e people who offer<br>
				black-collor-services like plumbing, house painting, laundry services. The project also had a tab <br>
				for those that wished tro be connected to abroad vacancies. Many are the times that those who go abroad,<br>
				and especialy to Arabs nation end up being mistreated  by their employers due to lack of a genuine<br>
				agent. The project aimed to solve this issue too.</P>
