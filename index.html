			<h3>Academic</h3>
			<p>[Ninety Nines Flying School] — [Ground School and Simulation Private Pilot License]<br>
				Time : [2015] — [2017]<br>
				This is a passion that still burns in me. Unluckily, I never got the chance to<br>
				finish my final license due to financial issues. Never given up but just took a <br>
				pause. For sure i will be going back to this field but as a bush pilot And<br>
				perhaps an aviator who solves aviation problems by means of coding and forming of<br>
				aligorithms.

			<p>[Glory Secondary School] — [Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education]<br>
				Time: [2012] — [2015]<br>
				Score: B<br>
				Back hear I had basically no idea what i will be after my high-school education.<br>
				howerver for sure i knew that i was going to land somewhere in the aviation industry.<br>
				How the future hides itself from us. It is the beauty of life. We will never know <br>
				tommorrow. The reason why we as humans always hope for the best but also be prepared<br>
				for the worst.
			</p>
			<p>[Ngei Primary School] — [Kenya Certificate of Primary Education]<br>
				Time: [2003] — [2012]<br>
				Score: B<br>
				The begining of it all. Basically i have very little memory of <br>
				this great childhood. I can recall I loved to play so much.
